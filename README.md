👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Prajjwal Dobriyal**.
I’m a developer who focuses on building clean, structured, and practical web solutions.

I work across the stack, combining frontend design, backend logic, and data analysis to turn ideas into usable products. I care less about flashy code and more about **clarity, maintainability, and real-world usefulness**.
